# Claire's First CS 193 Homework

## Favorite Things About CS 193!
- CS 193 presentation notes have a nice theme
- The scheduling for CS 193 works out perfectly as I am able to go to Windsor dining court on the way back to my dorm room at a good time for dinner
- I can learn about coding in terminal more in depth
