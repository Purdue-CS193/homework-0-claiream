# Claire's First CS 193 Homework

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
## Favorite Things About CS 193!
- CS 193 presentation notes have a nice theme
- The scheduling for CS 193 works out perfectly as I am able to go to Windsor dining court on the way back to my dorm room at a good time for dinner
- I can learn about coding in terminal more in depth

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
